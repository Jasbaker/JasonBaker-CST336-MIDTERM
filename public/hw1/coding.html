                <p><strong>In Engine Coding</strong></p><br /><br />
                Most of a games physics and graphics programming is all done in the game's respective engine.<br />
                Engines are sometimes built from the ground up in-house by development companies, and are then recycled for most of their projects.<br />
                At times engines can be licensed by third party game developers in order to simplify their process and development time.<br />
                Engines is the heart of what games  game look and sound the way that they do.
